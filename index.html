        <p>V was born Kim Tae-hyung on December 30, 1995, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seo_District,_Daegu">Seo District</a> of Daegu,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_(singer)#cite_note-5">[4][5]</a></sup> and grew up in Geochang County.[6] He is the eldest of three children, with a younger brother and sister.<sup>[7]</sup> V first aspired to be a professional singer in elementary <sup>[8]</sup> With his father's support,[9] he began taking saxophone lessons in early middle school as a means of pursuing a musical career.[7][8] V eventually became a trainee for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hit_Music">Big Hit Entertainment</a> after passing an audition in Daegu.[10]

            After graduating from Korean Arts High School in 2014,[11] V enrolled in Global Cyber University, graduating in August 2020 with a major in Broadcasting and Entertainment.[12] As of 2021, he is enrolled at Hanyang Cyber University, pursuing a Master of Business Administration in Advertising and Media.[13]
            Pre-debut, V was the "secret member" of BTS: fans were unaware of his existence as his agency wished to keep him a surprise. He later stated that the concept made him feel lonely and uneasy at the time as he thought it was because he might be cut from the lineup.[14] On June 13, 2013, he made his debut as a member of BTS on Mnet's M Countdown with the track "No More Dream" from the band's debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. V was first credited for music composition on The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 1 (2015) extended play (EP), as a co-writer and producer of the song "Hold Me Tight"; he also contributed lyrics for the song "Fun Boyz". On the band's follow up EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2, V's melody was used for the song "Run". He co-wrote and composed his first solo track "Stigma" for BTS' 2016 studio album Wings. He also released, unofficially, a cover of "Hug Me" with bandmate J-Hope, and "Someone Like You" by Adele.[15]

            In May 2018, V's second solo song, "Singularity", was released as a trailer for BTS' then-upcoming third studio album, Love Yourself: Tear. The track made its UK radio debut on BBC Radio on October 25.[16] One month after its release, The Guardian added "Singularity" to its "Top 50 songs for the month of June 2018" playlist,[17] and Billboard included it in their critics' list of the "Top 50 BTS songs" at number 28.[18] Overall, "Singularity" was generally well received by critics and mentioned on several year-end critic's lists. The New York Times ranked it twentieth on its list of "The 65 Best Songs of 2018" alongside "Fake Love",[19] Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood named it the fourth "best and most replay worthy song of 2018",[20] and Guardian critic Laura Snapes included it as one of her favourite tracks in her "Best Music of 2018: Albums and Tracks" list.[21]</p>
